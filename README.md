# Animal-Lovers

For this project we were required to work in a group of four to use two public API's and incorperate them into a working site of our own.

We decided to use the Library of congress API, and Ninjas animal API to be able to incroperate a animal website. This allows users to be able to search any animal to their liking and many facts/ attributes will come up about said animal.
