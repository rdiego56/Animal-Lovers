* For this project we were required to work in a group of four to use two public API's and incorperate them into a working site of our own.

* We decided to use the Library of congress API, and Ninjas animal API to be able to incroperate a animal website. This allows users to be able to search any animal to their liking and many facts/ attributes will come up about said animal.

* The project was broken down between the four members where each was assigned a task depending on what one was most comfortbale with. Two worked on CSS/foundation CSS and index.html, while the other two worked on javascript and incorperation of API's

* When the user clicks on the link they are introduced with the main page.

* On the top  left of the page there is a home and a about button where it redirects users to our about section or back to the main home page.

* When user input a animal into the search bar and click on search they are brought to another page.

* When redirected to the next page they are introduced with a variety of facts about the animals, in whihc the user is able to look through and learn. 

* When finished they can click on the home tab at the top left and they will be redirected back to the homepage where they can look up antother animal.
